        <h1>Welcome to My Site</h1>
            <h3>Home Improvement</h3>
                <p>We have been doing a lot of home improvement lately, because we bought a new house in March. It's exhausting, and I don't know when it will all be done.</p>
                <h4>Changes We've Made</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Took out a wall</li>
                    <li>Added a new vent hood</li>
                    <li>Painted</li>
                    <li>Took out a lot of bushes<img src="img/bushes.jpg" alt="Bushes being removed"></li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Wedding Planning</h3>
                <p>Along with buying a house, we're also planning a wedding. Surprisingly, that doing that is easier than home improvement.</p>
                <h4>Things We've done</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Picked a date</li>
                    <li>Decided what we're wearing</li>
                    <li>Picked our menu</li>
                    <li>Found a venue<img src="img/saltwater.jpeg" alt="Saltwater Farm Vineyard"></li>
                </ul>
