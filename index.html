            <h2>Home Improvement</h2>
                <p>We have been doing a lot of home improvement lately, because we bought a new house in March. It's exhausting, and I don't know when it will all be done.</p>
            <h2>Wedding Planning</h2>
                <p>Along with buying a house, we're also planning a wedding. Surprisingly, that doing that is easier than home improvement.</p>
